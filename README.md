# Closing the Gap in Non-Latin Script Data

The project aims to facilitate research in Digital Humanities projects dealing with Non-Latin Script in Latin Script environments. One of our goals is to gather and provide information on existing projects. As a first step, this repository is meant to contain basic information on research or infrastructure projects, initiatives and/or related institutions in a structured way.

This repository contains metadata information on projects and useful resources that can be loosely associated to the field of Digital Humanities and Non-Latin-Script-based research. This project is particularly interested in the situation of (digital) Arabic Studies and related fields.

## Schema Documentation

The schema underlies continuous development. Existing entries are not going to be automatically updated to newer versions of the schema. In case of issues, the creator or last editor will be contacted.

Feel free to discuss possible improvements the schema in the GitHub issues.

We will add a history of all upcoming schema versions beginning with `v0.1.6`.
