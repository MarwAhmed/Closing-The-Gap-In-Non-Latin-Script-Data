One part of the project was to get an idea on \n        the state of the field of \"Digitale Arabistik\" in Germany, mainly in terms of former, ongoing and future research projects, but also in terms of available infrastructure\n        and relevant initiatives in the field.</p>\n      <p class=\"my-4 text-left\">While we began gathering data on digital projects dealing with Arabic or similar languages, we thought about a way to provide the data we gathered\n        in a way that commits to OpenScience principles. So we chose an open git repo as our main data repository, offering the data as JSON in a way that should be\n        as easy as possible. Everyone who is interested should be able to contribute without having to deal with too much of a technology stack.</p>\n      <p class=\"my-4 text-left\">For those, who are not able or willing to learn JSON, we developed a Graphical User Interface that offers not only a list of all projects, we\n        gathered, but also small visualisations that we will continue to work on. For an easier way to provide data than writing in plain JSON, we developed\n        a form that generates the JSON. All features we offer will be improved over time, depending on the needs and demands of the community.</p>\n      <p class=\"my-8 text-xl\">If you want to contribute in any way, work on a localization of this service or want to report bugs or feature requests, feel free to contact us via <a class=\"font-bold\" href=\"https://github.com/M-L-D-H/Closing-The-Gap-In-Non-Latin-Script-Data\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.</p>\n      <p class=\"my-4\">Other initiatives and institutions, we are involved with, are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><a class=\"font-bold\" href=\"https://www.ada.fu-berlin.de/ada-labs/multilingual-dh/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Multilingual DH Lab @Freie Universität Berlin</a></li>\n        <li><a class=\"font-bold\" href=\"https://dig-hum.de/ag-multilingual-dh\" target=\"_blank\">DHd AG Multilingual DH</a></li>\n        <li>Decolonization initiatives @Freie Universität Berlin</li>\n        <li><a class=\"font-bold\" href=\"https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/semiarab/arabistik/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Seminar for Semitic and Arabic Studies</a></li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=f60ffcaa\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/Users/taikurit/Documents/git/fu/projects/GUI/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_hoisted_2","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_3","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
