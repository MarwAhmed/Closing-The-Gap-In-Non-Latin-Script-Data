# Keywords - documentation 
### Closing the Gap in Non-Latin Script Data  

Last edited: 12-07-2022

## Introduction 
Keywords should provide a general information about the topic, aim, result and type of a given project. To this end each project (except of RDM and infrastructure projects) should, if possible, contain at least one keyword for each category: 
-	`output` - the aimed results of the project or services provided
-	`field` - the field of study that the project can be assigned to 
-	`research object` – information about the subject matter, topic or materials on with the research is being conducted. It can be both *general* (e.g. manuscripts) and *specific* (e.g. manuscripts´ author)
-	`languages` - research data languages formatted according to the ISO 639-2 language codes (or ISO 639-3 if a given languages is not provided)
-	`infrastructure projects` – for infrastructure and RDM projects keywords are not necessary, as they can be found through the *topic_relations* category. If available though, keywords should describe the kind of service provided or technology used
-	`other` – for any keywords not matching the above mentioned 

For the most part, the number of keywords should not exceed 5  (research data languages excluded) - all written in lower-case and spaces are to be replaced with underscores. New keywords can be added if the existing ones do not relate to, or do not describe a given project properly.
